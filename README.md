## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`) in the Boston area using various features from the dataset.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install the required packages:**
    - Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
      ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    - Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
      ```sh
      jupyter notebook
      ```
    - Open the notebook file and run the cells to execute the code.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

1. **Load the Boston Housing dataset and display the first 5 rows.**
    - `data.head()`

2. **Generate descriptive statistics.**
    - `data.describe()`

3. **Create a correlation heatmap for all features in the dataset.**
    - `createHeatmap(data)`

4. **Plot a scatter plot of 'RM' (average number of rooms) vs. 'MEDV' (median value of owner-occupied homes).**
    - `createScatterPlot(data, 'RM', 'MEDV')`

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

1. **Check for missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.**
    - `data.info()`
    - `data.isnull().sum()`

2. **Normalize the numerical features using `StandardScaler`.**
    - `scaler = StandardScaler()`
    - `scaled_inputs = scaler.transform(scaler_data)`

3. **Create a new feature that represents the ratio of 'LSTAT' to 'RM'.**
    - `scaled_inputs_df['lstat_rm_ratio'] = scaled_inputs_df["LSTAT"] / scaled_inputs_df["RM"]`

## Model Building and Evaluation

1. **Implement a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
    - Train the model on the training data.
    - Make predictions on the test data.
    - Calculate and print the Mean Squared Error and R-squared score.

2. **Implement a Random Forest Regressor for the same prediction task.**
    - Use the same train-test split as in Task 1.
    - Train the model with at least 100 trees.
    - Make predictions on the test data.
    - Calculate and print the Mean Squared Error and R-squared score.
    - Plot feature importance for the top 5 most important features.

## Advanced ML Challenge

1. **Implement a simple neural network using PyTorch to predict house prices.**
    - Preprocess the data appropriately for neural network input.
    - Design a network with at least one hidden layer.
    - Train the model for a suitable number of epochs.
    - Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared score.

## Results

The results of the models are compared based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score:

- **Linear Regression**
    - Mean Squared Error: `mse_linear`
    - R Squared Error: `rse_linear`

- **Random Forest Regressor**
    - Mean Squared Error: `mse_forest`
    - R Squared Error: `rse_forest`

- **Neural Network**
    - Mean Squared Error: `mse`
    - R Squared Error: `r2`

From the results, we can conclude that the `RandomForestRegressor` has a lower error rate compared to `LinearRegression` and `LinearRegression_NeuralNetwork`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of predicting house prices using various machine learning models. The Random Forest Regressor outperformed the other models in terms of prediction accuracy.
